== About this exercise

The main purpose of this exercise is to explore the main Forge features by creating a simple Jira application that adds generated user information on Jira issues.

[NOTE]
====
*And what about Confluence ?* +
This first exercise only covers Jira, but many features are shared between Jira and Confluence (UI kit, triggers, ...).
Currently, only `macro` are specific to Confluence.
====

**Here is the plan**: first thing to do is create an administration page, to allow users configuring our application.
Once it's done, we will listen to issue creations in Jira by using the `trigger` mechanism.
Then, when an issue is created, we will retrieve our application settings from the Forge `storage` and `fetch` a remote API to retrieve our user information and store them into the created issue.
Finally, the information will be rendered inside the issue, using an `issue panel`.

The exercise is split into 4 parts:

. Set up the Forge application;
. Create the application administration;
. Configure the issue creation trigger;
. Display the user information in the issue;

At the end of each part (except the Forge setup), you will be asked to implement a solution by yourself.
However, a solution is available in this repository if needed.

[TIP]
====
These exercises will require you to explore the https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/[Forge documentation] to understand and discover Forge capabilities.
If needed, don't hesitate to ask for help on the https://community.developer.atlassian.com/c/forge/45[Atlassian Developer Community].
